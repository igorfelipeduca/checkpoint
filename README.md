# Checkpoint

![thumb](/public/print.png)

## Checkpoint is an open-source platform that make it possible for you to share your experience with various games. Our main purpose is to unite the community to build an indie project that represents one of our favorite activities: gaming.

### How Checkpoint should work?

Checkpoint have some must-have features, here they are:

- [ ] Integration of a game database in order to list and display as many games as possbile
- [ ] Retrieve public information about those games (to bring up what real gamers think about those games) -- this item could possibly be resolved with some youtube gameplay scrapping
- [ ] Retrieve the total amount of the game tasks, so the gamers could mark at what task or campaign they are at this moment and Checkpoint will calculate how many hours or percentage of the game are pending until the campaing is fully completed.
- [ ] Timeline: this feature will make Checkpoint look like a real social media. The timeline must have news about the games publishers or show what games the user friends are playing at this moment.

### About Checkpoint's stack

- NextJs 14
